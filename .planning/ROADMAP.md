# Roadmap: Mushroom Farm — FC-1 Humidity Control (and beyond)

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 MVP — FC-1 Humidity Control** — Phases 1–8 (shipped 2026-04-11). See `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md` for full details.
- 📋 **v1.1 (planned)** — tech debt closure + farm-driven priorities. To be scoped via `/gsd:new-milestone`.

## Current Phases

_No active phases. v1.0 shipped 2026-04-11. Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to scope v1.1._

<summary>✅ v1.0 MVP (Phases 1-8) — SHIPPED 2026-04-11</summary>

- [x] Phase 1: Pi Integration & Environment (5/5 plans) — 2026-03-29
- [x] Phase 2: Safety Hardening (4/4 plans) — 2026-03-30
- [x] Phase 3: Closed-Loop Control (3/3 plans) — 2026-04-04
- [x] Phase 4: Observability & Integration (2/2 plans) — 2026-04-04
- [x] Phase 5: Production Deployment (2/2 plans) — 2026-04-11 (grower-attested)
- [x] Phase 6: WireGuard / Tailscale ROS routing (3/3 plans) — 2026-03-29
- [x] Phase 7: Historical Data & OpenMCT time-series (2/2 plans) — 2026-04-07 (regression fixed 2026-04-11)
- [x] Phase 8: Pi Camera Feed in Mission Control (4/4 plans) — 2026-04-09

Grower verdict 2026-04-11: "better than the timer". Unexpected star of the
show: SCD41 CO2 readings (no prior CO2 instrumentation at the farm).

Tech debt carried to v1.1: ACTR-03 bridge QoS, CAM-03 phantom CycloneDDS
subscriber, fc-core boot race on tailscale0 interface, SHT30 physical
reinstall. See `.planning/milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`.

## Backlog (parking lot)

These are ideas captured during v1.0 execution but not yet scoped into a
milestone. Promote with `/gsd:review-backlog` when ready.

- **Phase 999.1: Edge buffering** — local SQLite/Timescale on Pi with store-and-forward to elder-plops for offline resilience.
- **Phase 999.2: FarmOS integration** — bridge into the farm-wide FarmOS instance for mushroom production tracking. Blocked on farm team completing schema design.
- **Phase 999.3: Alerts & notifications** — Signal bot for humidity/CO2/Pi-offline/actuator-stuck conditions. Foundation already in place (bridge `/health`, WebSocket broadcast, DB).
- **Phase 999.4: Environmental expansion — fan & light telemetry** — GPIO27 fan MOSFET + fan/light state publishers + Mission Control charts.
- **Phase 999.5: Vision — time-lapse & growth monitoring** — ffmpeg time-lapse composition, pinning/maturity detection, contamination alerts. Feeds Phase 999.3 for grower-facing pinning and "ready to pick" notifications.
- **Phase 999.6: Multi-chamber scaling** — parameterize chamber_id, enable FC-2/FC-3.
- **Phase 999.7: Farm rover** — mobile inspection/actuation platform (camera + airgun + misting nozzle) on a ROS2 rover. Depends on 999.5, 999.3, 999.6.
