<summary>🚧 v1.2.1 Hotfix — camera stall + sensor warmup (Phases 14-15) — FILED 2026-04-17</summary>

- [ ] Phase 14: fc_camera idle-mode stall hotfix — farmer-facing symptom (frozen MC image) from Phase 12 regression. Diagnose root cause first (not just patch symptom); add two status lights in MC camera panel; bundle `last_frame_age_sec` in bridge `/health`. Context: `.planning/phases/14-fc-camera-idle-stall-hotfix/14-CONTEXT.md`
  **Plans:** 5 plans
  - [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — live-stall diagnostic (Path A vs B); no-op safe; produces 14-DIAGNOSTIC-RESULT.md
  - [x] 14-02-PLAN.md — fc_camera 1Hz graph-poll fallback + TestIdleToActiveRecovery unit tests
  - [x] 14-03-PLAN.md — bridge /health adds camera.last_frame_age_sec; rebuild on elder-plops
  - [x] 14-04-PLAN.md — MC two status lights ("Feed live" + "Camera subscribed") via makeStatusLight primitive
  - [x] 14-05-PLAN.md — deploy to fc1/prod + 30-min live soak; 14-SOAK-EVIDENCE.md with SOAK_PASS verdict
- [ ] Phase 15: Sensor warm-up grace period — promoted from 999.8 at farmer's explicit ask 2026-04-17. Farmer constraint: "bigger gap than noise" — publish nothing (or explicit warming-up state) rather than spiky/wrong values during the ~30s post-restart transient. Context: `.planning/phases/15-sensor-warmup-grace-period/15-CONTEXT.md`
  **Plans:** 3 plans
  - [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — controller grace gate + /fc1/sensor_health publisher + unit tests + package.xml diagnostic_msgs dep
  - [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — REQUIREMENTS.md cleanup: promote SENS-01 to v1.2.1 active (deduplicate Future/Out-of-Scope)
  - [x] 15-03-PLAN.md — deploy to fc1/prod via deploy.sh + live soak; 15-03-SOAK-EVIDENCE.md with SOAK_PASS verdict
- [ ] Phase 16: System health panel — narrow six-light strip for fc1 subsystems (Sensors, Camera feed, Humidifier, Bridge, Pi reachable, Grace). Reuses Phase 14 makeStatusLight primitive; consumes signals already on the stack plus one small bridge extension. Context: `.planning/phases/16-system-health-panel/16-CONTEXT.md`. Milestone TBD (v1.2.1 stretch or v1.3).
  **Plans:** 3 plans
  - [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md — bridge forwards /fc1/sensor_health + exposes ros.connected and humidifier.last_msg_ts on /health
  - [ ] 16-02-PLAN.md — plugin.js adds six-light horizontal health strip (new openmct type + view)
  - [ ] 16-03-PLAN.md — smoke test live stack; produces 16-SMOKE-EVIDENCE.md with SMOKE_PASS verdict

Filed during a farmer debug session on the camera feed. Both issues erode
operator trust in Mission Control and should ship together as a small
hotfix before the next feature milestone.

## Backlog (parking lot)

These are ideas captured during v1.0/v1.1 execution but not yet scoped into a
milestone. Promote with `/gsd:review-backlog` when ready.

- **Phase 999.1: Edge buffering** — local SQLite/Timescale on Pi with store-and-forward to elder-plops for offline resilience.
- **Phase 999.2: FarmOS integration** — bridge into the farm-wide FarmOS instance for mushroom production tracking. Blocked on farm team completing schema design.
- **Phase 999.3: Alerts & notifications** — Signal bot for humidity/CO2/Pi-offline/actuator-stuck conditions. Foundation already in place (bridge `/health`, WebSocket broadcast, DB).
- **Phase 999.4: Environmental expansion — fan & light telemetry** — GPIO27 fan MOSFET + fan/light state publishers + Mission Control charts.
- **Phase 999.5: Vision — time-lapse & growth monitoring** — ffmpeg time-lapse composition, pinning/maturity detection, contamination alerts. Feeds Phase 999.3 for grower-facing pinning and "ready to pick" notifications.
- **Phase 999.6: Multi-chamber scaling** — parameterize chamber_id, enable FC-2/FC-3.
- **Phase 999.7: Farm rover** — mobile inspection/actuation platform (camera + airgun + misting nozzle) on a ROS2 rover. Depends on 999.5, 999.3, 999.6.
- ~~Phase 999.8~~ — **promoted to Phase 15** (v1.2.1 hotfix) 2026-04-17 at farmer's request.
- **Phase 999.9: PID + time-proportional humidity control** — replace bang-bang with a PID loop that outputs a 0–100% duty cycle, translated by the actuator layer into time-proportional on/off windows (HVAC-style slow PWM on the binary SSR mister). **Empirically justified 2026-04-11:** farmer calibration session proved bang-bang + 180s dwell has a structural regulation ceiling of ~±2% RH — dwell forces a +2.0% overshoot under a ±0.5% band, 4× the band width itself. Narrower bands provide no additional regulation benefit under the current control law. Full system-ID data (rise/decay rates, deadtime, step response, nonlinear gain scheduling implications, recommended time-proportional window length and interim operating band) captured in `.planning/phases/999.9-pid-time-proportional-humidity-control/CALIBRATION-FINDINGS-2026-04-11.md` — feedback from the farmer/operator to the dev team. Touches `fc_controller.py` substantially, new actuator duty-cycle primitive, PID tuning params, test suite expansion. Interim band until this ships: `humidity_tolerance: 0.01` (±1%).
- **Phase 999.10: On-demand camera streaming (4G credit thrift)** — `fc_camera` currently publishes `/fc1/camera/compressed` continuously regardless of viewers. At 1 FPS × ~24 KB/frame that's ~2 GB/day of constant cellular traffic, most of it watching nothing. Farmer flagged 2026-04-11 — this will chew through the 4G hotspot credit. Interim workaround applied same day: `camera_fps` lowered from 1.0 → 0.0167 (~1 frame/min, ~35 MB/day), and `camera_fps` default in `fc_camera.py` changed to float to allow sub-1 values. Proper fix: make `fc_camera` subscriber-aware — idle (or drop to a trickle like 1/min) when `count_subscribers('/fc1/camera/compressed') == 0`, ramp to full configured rate when a Mission Control viewer connects. Bridge already owns the MJPEG client set and could hint via a ROS service call. Touches `fc_camera.py` (subscriber polling or service server), possibly `mission_control_bridge` (viewer-state signaling), `fc_config.yaml` (idle-rate param). Not a v1.0 blocker — the YAML workaround holds until 4G budget pressure forces the proper fix.
- **Phase 999.11: Farmer app (operator + grower UI)** — a dedicated app for the farmer's daily workflow: status glance, historical "story view", camera feed, parameter changes, "flag it" backlog capture. Mission Control (OpenMCT) is the engineer surface; the Farmer app is the operator/grower surface. Mobile-first, offline-tolerant over 4G, role-aware (operator vs grower modes). Captured from lived experience during the 2026-04-11 calibration session where Claude Code acted as an ad-hoc farmer app and exposed every gap. **Biggest lesson from that session:** sensor health must be so prominent it is impossible to ignore — today we calibrated against SCD41 humidity for 40 minutes without noticing SHT30 was offline. Full field notes with workflow moments, UI wishes, pitfall reminders, and a 3-item MVP prioritization are in `.planning/phases/999.11-farmer-app/FARMER-APP-NOTES-2026-04-11.md`. Depends on nothing strictly; composes well with 999.3 (alerts/Signal), 999.5 (vision/time-lapse), 999.10 (on-demand camera).
- **Phase 999.13: Upgrade docker-compose v1 → v2** — elder-plops runs compose 1.29.2 which hit a `ContainerConfig` KeyError during v1.1 bridge deploy (2026-04-12), requiring manual `docker rm -f` + recreate. Compose v2 (`docker compose` plugin) fixes this. Container names change from underscores to hyphens (`mushy_bridge_1` → `mushy-bridge-1`) — grep for hardcoded references first. Low risk, high annoyance reduction.
- **Phase 999.14: Camera history — continuous persistence + MC timeline scrubber** — Two issues surfaced during a farmer debug session 2026-04-17 (fc_camera idle-mode stall + discovery that Phase 12's subscriber-aware bridge means idle-pulse frames are never persisted when no one's watching). Original framing ("just index the existing files") was too narrow: indexing a discontinuous history gives a scrubber with blank hours. Real scope: (1) decide who persists idle frames — bridge stays at trickle subscription, or Pi-side history ring buffer, or dedicated archivist subscriber; (2) index in Timescale (`snapshots` table: camera_id, captured_at, file_path, bytes) alongside `saveSnapshot()` (`src/mission-control/bridge/src/index.js:381`); (3) MC timeline scrubber UI. Full findings and scope discussion in `.planning/phases/999.14-index-camera-snapshots-in-timescale/FINDINGS-2026-04-17.md`. Composes with 999.1 (edge-buffering), 999.5 (time-lapse), 999.11 (farmer app story view).
- **Phase 999.12: Weather telemetry enrichment** — poll Open-Meteo API from Mission Control side (sidecar container or bridge addition), write outdoor temp/humidity/pressure/precipitation to TimescaleDB, display alongside fc1 chamber data in Mission Control. Proxy for a local weather station until one is installed. Farmer request from first 24h of live data (2026-04-12): correlate outdoor conditions with chamber behavior (e.g. wet day → humidifier never fires, RH stays above 83%). Must NOT run on Pi — runs on elder-plops alongside existing Mission Control stack. Touches: new container or bridge module, TimescaleDB schema for weather table, Mission Control layout. Composes well with 999.11 (farmer app — weather context in "story view").
